This is a collection of mostly assorted git helpers, aimed at easing
the use of git when doing branches and working with Patchwork.

You can set your PATH to point to the working copy of this directory,
and git will automatically pick up all those scripts and treat them as
new git commands.

================================================================================
1) Easier branch work

A new "model" of branching is introduced with those scripts:

  - for every branch, a tag is created at the branch-point

  - the tag is named after the branch (with a prefix to avoid
    naming ambiguity)

  - scripts in this repo that deal with branches expect (or set)
    such tags


Here are the scripts that will deal with such branches:

    git-tag-and-branch BRANCH
        create a branch BRANCH and the corresponding start-tag

    git-branches
        list all managed branches and the number of commits since
        their start-tag in each of them, plus a total of all commits
        on all such branches

    git-blog
        git-log such a branch, from its start-tag to its HEAD

    git-rebase-and-retag NEW_START BRANCH
        rebase the branch BRANCH ontop of NEW_START, recreating
        the start-tag on NEW_START

    git-empty-branch
        report such branches with no commit between their start-tag
        and HEAD

    git-rm-branch BRANCH
        delete the branch BRANCH and its start-tag


================================================================================
2) merge-branch

A new concept introduced in addition to the new branmching model above,
is the 'merge-branch'. A merge-branch is a branch on which there is a
single commit, which is the merge of one or more other branches.

A merge-branch is a branch with a start-tag, like above.

    git-remerge-and-retag NEW_START BRANCH [additional branches]
        remerge the branch BRANCh (and any additional branches) on top
        of NEW_START, and tag NEW_START as the new start-tag of the
        branch


================================================================================
3) bulk rebasing/remerging

Busy devloppers may have a lot of local branches, that they may wish to
rebase all on top of a common cset (i.e. to rebase after a new release
was made, or to follow the maste rbranch aggressively...)

    git-rebase-all NEW_STAR PATTERN
        calls either git-rebase-and-retag or git-remerge-and-retag on
        branches that match the regexp PATTERN.


================================================================================
4) Dealing with Patchwork

Patchwork stores all patches received on a mailing lit, and makes them
available from a WEB UI and via a JSON-formatted XML-RPC interface.

    git-pwc
        wrapper around pwclient, that will retrieve the list of patches,
        and display a dialog-based UI to select patches to apply

    git-pwv PATCH_ID
        wrapper around pwclient, to view the patch with ID PATCH_ID
        and display it in a format not unlike git-show.


================================================================================
5) Pull requests

A lot of projects use pull-requests to ask the maintainer to pull in sets of
changes. As well, a lot of projects prefer to have patches sent to a mailing
list.

    git-send-pull-request BASE REMOTE HEAD [options]
        prepare a cover-letter with the content of git-request-pull, and
        prepare the patches for BASE..HEAD. Open an editor to complete the
        cover-letter. Send the cover-letter with all pathces as replies to
        the cover-letter.

        git-send-pull-request is quite versatile: it can instruct patchwork
        to ignore the cover-letter and.or the patches, add recipients (To:,
        Cc: or Bcc:), handles series versions, send patches or not, append
        a suffix as in [PATCH vN/M SUFFIX]... Use '-h' to see help.


================================================================================
6) Misc

    git-gc-all PATH
        recursively scan PATH for all git trees, and run git-gc in each
        of them

    git-mk-archive CSET NAME COMP [OUT_DIR]
        generate an archive with git-archive, extracting changeset CSET
        with the prefix set to NAME-CSET/ and compressed with COMP (one
        of gz, bz2, xz). If OUT_DIR is specified, the archive is stored
        in OUT_DIT/NAME-CSET.tar.COMP; if OUT_DIR is not set, the
        archive is sent to stdout.

    git-out
        equivalent of git-push -n

    git-push-all
        pushes all local branch to all remotes that have a push-url
        not set to /dev/null
